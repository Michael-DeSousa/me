# Project Overview

Hello, my name is Michael De Sousa and this is my personal website/portfolio! I started this project after graduating in 2021 so that I could organize all of my projects and contact links. 

The project is a single page React application and is deployed on Github Pages. It is split up into 4 main sections:
- About Me: A short bio about me along with all relevent social media links and my resume
- Projects: A gallery of my latest projects along with links to their source code and demo videos
- Skills: A quick overview of the programming languages and tools I am experienced with
- Contact Me: A small contact form created using [formsubmit.co](https://formsubmit.co/) (to prevent spam)
